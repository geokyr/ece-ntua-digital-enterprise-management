Lab Assignments for the [Management of the Digital Enterprise](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/undergraduate/courses/3365) course, during the 8th semester of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens.

## Lab Assignments

There were 5 lab assignments in total, each one of them focusing on a different topic. The topics are briefly described below.

## Lab 01 - Creating an e-shop

The first lab was about creating an e-shop that sells vinyl records. The e-shop was created using the open-source tool [Magento](http://www.magentocommerce.com//), that was pre-installed on a provided virtual machine image. The main tasks of the lab could be split into 6 categories:

- Design of the e-shop
- Catalogue and Product Management
- Payments and Shipping Methods
- Community Settings and Google Sitemap
- Simulation of Customer Behavior
- Back Office Management

## Lab 02 - Modelling and Implementing a Business Process

The second lab required the modelling and implementation of a business process using the [BPMN 2.0](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/) standard. The business process was about the management of the e-shop (e.g. related to supply chain management) that was created in the first lab assigment. The [Camunda Modeler](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/) tool was used to model the business process and the [Camunda BPM platform](https://camunda.com/download/) was used to implement it.

## Lab 03 - Enterprise Resource Planning

The third lab focuses on the management of business resources (e.g. warehouse, accounting, etc.) using an appropriate ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system. The [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) ERP system was used to implement the business processes of a company that sells movie DVDs.

## Lab 04 - Searching and Recommender Systems

The fourth lab deals with the application of various recommender methods on data in order to derive the corresponding "recommendations" to be given to customers, as well as the evaluation of the results of virtual searches carried out by customers. TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity were used to rank the results of a virtual search, while Precision, Recall and F-Measure were used to calculate statistics for the results. Finally, a recommender system was implemented, using the Euclidean Distance and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient as similarity metrics, and then K-Nearest Neighbors was used to make recommendations.

## Lab 05 - Process Mining

The fifth lab aims to exploit process mining techniques for the discovery and evaluation of business processes based on the analysis of event logs extracted from information systems. [Disco](https://fluxicon.com/disco/), a business process data analysis tool, was used to analyze the event logs and then discover and evaluate the corresponding business processes.
